      Professional software engineer, passionate thinker and aspiring creator â€” at least that's who I think I am.
      Instead of trying to organize my nuanced, fluid and vivid life experiences into simple, discrete and digestible bullet points for the sake of filling a job description, I just want to start documenting my life.
      I created this site to share my reflections and incomplete thoughts, not to publish a curated snapshot of who I want you to think I am.
      And maybe along te way, I'll start to get a better sense of who I actually am.
