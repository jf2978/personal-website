Instead of trying to organize my nuanced, fluid and vivid life experiences into simple, discrete and digestible bullet points for the sake of filling a job description, I just want to start documenting my life. I created this site to share my reflections and incomplete thoughts, not to publish a curated snapshot of who I want you to think I am. And maybe along the way, I'll start to get a better sense of who I actually am."
